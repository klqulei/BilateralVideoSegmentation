## BilateralVideoSegmentation

This is a *personal* reimplementation of the method proposed in *Bilateral Space Video Segmentation* [Maerki et al. 2016]. 
Importantly, it was written for clarity of understanding, and is totally unoptimized (i.e. IT'S SLOW and uses a LOT of memory).
Furthermore, it only partially implements the published method, featuring only multi-linear interpolation. 
For realistic timing and results to compare against, please refer to the material included in the original publication.

### GRAPHCUT

This method also uses a third party [GraphCut library](http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/). Please refer to the
webpage for the most up to date information.

### DATA

The datasets included originate from the [FBMS-59 dataset](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/).
The datasets are provided only for research purposes and without any warranty. When using the BMS-26 or FBMS-59 in your 
research work, you should cite the appropriate papers in the link above.

### C++ Implementation
Scott Wehrwein implemented a version of BVS in C++ for his project on foreground/background segmentation. You can find it [here](https://github.com/swehrwein/vsbmm).
